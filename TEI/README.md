# ParlaMint TEI

This directory contains the TEI ODD for the ParlaMint corpora and derived XML schemas in various
formats (RelaxNG, W3C schema and DTD), along with scripts for conversion and validation of the
Parla-CLARIN TEI ODD schema and supporting documents.

Note that the ParlaMint ODD is primarily meant as the source of documentation for ParlaMint corpora,
   while   

Note that the directory should include the TEI Stylesheets, which are, however .gitgnored. So,
before using the conversions, the [Stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets) should be
cloned into this directory.
