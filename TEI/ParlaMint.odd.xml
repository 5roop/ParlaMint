        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>This document details the structure of ParlaMint corpora of parliamentary
        proceedings. In order for the ParlaMint corpora to be interoperable (i.e. so that the
        same scripts can be used to process them), their structure is fairly rigid, both in
        terms of filenames and folder structre, as well as their actual XML encoding. This is
        not to say that all the corpora have to contain exactly the same information, as we
        distinguish obligatory information, which all the corpora should contain, from that
        which is optional, and present only in the corpora for which it has been possible to
        gather it from the corpus sources.</p>

	<p>This document is a specialisation of <ref
	target="https://clarin-eric.github.io/parla-clarin/">Parla-CLARIN</ref>, itself a
	customisation of TEI, the Text Enciding Initiative Guidelines. But while Parla-CLARIN
	gives fairly general recommendation for encoding corpora of parliamentary proceeding,
	and makes good introductory reading, ParlaMint, as mentioned, is much stricter and
	this document, while copying certain parts of the Parla-CLARIN recommendations, in
	general, just gives very specific encoding recommendations, without necessarily
	stating the reasons for their choice.</p>

        <p>The rest of these recommendations are structured as follows:
        <list>
          <item><ref target="#sec-overall">Section 2</ref> explains the overall XML

      </div>

      <div xml:id="sec-overall">
        <head>Overall corpus structure</head>
        
        <p>Each ParlaMint corpus is one XML document, which has as its root element
        <gi>teiCorpus</gi>, which then contains a <gi>teiHeader</gi> giving the metadata
        for the corpus as a whole (further detailed in the Section on <ref
        target="#sec-metadata">Corpus metadata</ref>), followed by a series of
        <gi>TEI</gi> elements that each contain one corpus component, as
        illustratied<note>Note that this is a illustrative example, e.g. a valid
        ParlaMint corpus would also need certain attributes to be defined on the
        illustrated elements. This holds for all the examples in this section.</note>
        below:
          
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-docstructure">
          <teiCorpus>
            <teiHeader>
              <!-- Common corpus metadata -->
            </teiHeader>
	    <!-- First corpus component -->
            <TEI>...</TEI>
	    <!-- Second corpus component -->
            <TEI>...</TEI>
	    <!-- More corpus components -->
          </teiCorpus>
        </egXML>
	
	The fact that a corpus is one XML document does not mean that it is also stored
	in one file. In fact, ParlaMint requires that each <term>corpus component</term> is
	stored as one file, with the <term>corpus root</term> also stored as one file.</p>

	<p>To enable one XML document to be composed of many files, we use the <ref
	target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</ref> mechanism, and the corpus
	root will XInclude its corpus component files, so a corpus root will be in fact
	encoded similarly to the follwing example:

        <eg xml:id="exa-xinclude">
          <teiCorpus>
            <teiHeader>
              <!-- Common corpus metadata -->
            </teiHeader>
	    <!-- Reference to the first corpus component -->
            <![CDATA[<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
		     href="2014/ParlaMint-NL_2014-04-16.xml"/>]]>
	    <!-- Reference to the second corpus component -->
            <![CDATA[<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
		     href="2014/ParlaMint-NL_2014-04-17.xml"/>]]>
	    <!-- References to more corpus components -->
          </teiCorpus>
        </eg>
        </p>

        <p>Each corpus component should should contain the transcripts for one day.
        Note, however, that several components can contain the transcript for the same
        day, but e.g. for different (types of) sittings. How and if these further
        subdivisions are realised is depedent on the corpus, as the granularity of
        parliamentary proceedings corpora, not to mention the national rules of
        structuring the workings of the parliament, differ substantially.</p>

	<p>A corpus component will thus be rooted in the <gi>TEI</gi> element, which
	then contains its own <gi>teiHeader</gi>, followed by the <gi>text</gi> element,
	which contains only the <gi>body</gi> element, this one containing the
	transctiption of the particular component, as illustrated below:
	
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-docstructure2">
          <TEI>
            <teiHeader>
              <!-- Corpus component metadata -->
            </teiHeader>
            <text>
              <body>
                <!-- Transcription -->
              </body>
            </text>
          </TEI>
        </egXML>
	</p>
	
	<p>The <gi>teiHeader</gi> of a corpus component (further detailed in the Section on
	<ref target="#sec-metadata">Corpus metadata</ref>) contains the metadata specific for
	this component (along with some redundant metadata about the provenance), and which
	should be unique in the corpus, i.e. the corpus component metadata should distinguish
	it from all the other components of the corpus.</p>
        </div>
	
	<div xml:id="sec-general">
          <head>General requirements</head>
          
          <p>This section gives some general requirements a ParlaMint corpus has to meet, in
          particular those relating to the characters in a corpus, and the use of
          standards. It also details the structure of the file names of the ParlaMint root and
          component files, as well as the exact form of the <gi>teiCorpus</gi> and
          <gi>TEI</gi> tags.</p>
	  
	  <div xml:id="sec-chars">
            <head>Characters</head>
            
            <p>The corpus should be encoded in Unicode, using the UTF-8 character encoding, at
            least for European languages.  In cases where the original contains characters from
            the Unicode Private Use Area, these should, if possible, be given their closest
            Unicode equivalents, or substituted by the Unicode replacement character
            U+FFFD. End-of-line hyphens, if present in the source files, should be removed, and
            the split words joined in order to enhance searching the corpus and to simplify
            linguistic processing.</p>
            
            <p>The following characters, esp. prevalent when the source documents were in Word or
            HTML, deserve special mention:
            
            <list>
              <item>TAB (U+0009) character helps the alignment of strings on successive
              lines.  As Parla-CLARIN is not interested in preserving the details of the
              layout, it is recommended that tab characters are substituted by the 
              space character (U+0020).</item>
              
              <item>NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0) prevents, with some applications, an automatic
              line break at its position and collapsing consecutive such space characters
              into a single space. As the use of this character complicates (or breaks)
              further processing, esp. linguistic annotation, it is recommended that these
              characters are substituted by the normal space character (U+0020). The same
              holds for other variants of spaces (U+2000 - U+200A), which are, however,
              used much less frequently.</item>
              
              <item>NON-BREAKING HYPHEN (U+2011), similarly to NO-BREAK SPACE, prevents a
              line break, in this case following its position. With a similiar reasoning as
              above, and, additionally, complicates searching, it is recommended that this
              character is substituted by the normal hyphen character ('-', U+002D).</item>
              
              <item>SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD) indicates that a word can be hyphenated at that
              point. Occurrences of this character should be removed from the corpus.</item>
            </list>
            </p>
            
            <p>Text-bearing elements should also not start or end with space characters, and
            sequences of whitespace characters should be changed into a single space.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div xml:id="sec-standard">
            <head>Standard values</head>
	    
            <p>Whenever possible, ParlaMint uses standards for information coding. In
            particular, the following information must be standardised:
	    <list>
	      <item>As the identity of a ParlaMint corpus is determined by the country or
	      region of the particular parliament, its code appears in many places. For
	      specifying these codes, the <ref
	      target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes">ISO
	      3166</ref> standard should be used, in particular <ref
	      target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1
	      alpha-2</ref> for the two letter codes of the countries (for national
	      parliaments) and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO
	      3166-2</ref> for the names of country subdivision (for parliaments of autonomous
	      provinces). So, for example, the country code for Spain is "ES", while the code
	      for the Basque autonomous community is "ES-PV".</item>
	      
	      <item>The codes for the languages used in the corpora (i.e. the possible values
	      of the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute) should follow <ref
	      target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref> (cf. also <q><ref
	      target="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-xmllang">xml:lang in
	      XML document schemas</ref></q>. Essentially, this means that the value for a
	      language code should have two letters, following <ref
	      target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO_639-1</ref>
	      or, and only if a two letter code does not exist for a language, the
	      three-letter <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2">ISO
	      639-2/T</ref> code. For example, the code for Basque is 'eu'. ParlaMint corpora
	      will use at least two languages, i.e. the language that the transcriptions are
	      written in, which we will call the <term>local language</term> and English, as
	      the meta-language, which is (also) used in the metadata.
	      </item>
	      
	      <item>ParlaMint also makes a lot of use of temporal information, i.e. to
	      determine when a session took place, or from (and maybe to) when a certain
	      person was an MP. To specify a date or time <ref
	      target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</ref> should be used,
	      for ParlaMint typically giving just the date, e.g. "2022-04-01". Temporal values
	      are usually stored in the <att>when</att>, <att>from</att> and <att>to</att>
	      attributes of various elements.</item>
	    </list>
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div xml:id="sec-files">
            <head>Filenames and directory structure</head>

	    <p>The filenames of a ParlaMint XML corpus root and its components have a fairly
	    rigid structure:
	    <list>
	      <item>The corpus root filename should start with the string
	      <q>ParlaMint-</q>, followed by the country (or region) code, e.g. (assuming the
	      country code for the corpus is <q>NL</q>) <q>ParlaMint-NL.xml</q>.</item>
	      
	      <item>For special cases, such as a corpus that has been (machine-)translated to
	      a language different from the original language of the transcriptions, we also
	      require the code of the language to follow the country code, e.g (assuming the
	      language code for the translated corpus is <q>en</q>) the corpus root file
	      should be named <q>ParlaMint-XX-yy.xml</q>.
	      </item>

	      <item>A corpus component always starts with the name of the root, followed by an
	      underscore and the date of the transcript, for example
	      <q>ParlaMint-XX_2018-10-30.xml</q></item>

	      <item>In case a corpus component is further distinguished by e.g. the type of
	      session because there are several components with the same date, the corpus
	      compilers are free to extend the filename by a hyphen and any suffix, which
	      should, however, contain only ASCII letters and numbers and the hyphen
	      character, e.g. <q>ParlaMint-NL_2018-10-30-eerstekamer-4.xml</q> or, for a Czech
	      component file, <q>ParlaMint-CZ_2016-04-13-ps2013-044-02-016-098.xml</q></item>

	      <item>The filenames of the corpus as a whole or corpus components that have been
	      automatically converted from the source XML files should have the same name as
	      the corpus root or components, respectivelly, but with appropriate file
	      extensions; this is further explained in the Section on <ref
	      target="#sec-conversion">Conversions</ref>.</item>
	    </list>

	    The complete corpus should be stored in a directory that has the same name prefix
	    as the corpus root file. The directory then contains the corpus root file, while
	    the corpus components should be found in subdirectory, one per year, for example:
	    
            <eg xml:id="exa-directories">
	      ParlaMint-BE.TEI/ParlaMint-BE.xml
	      ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2014/ParlaMint-BE_2014-06-19.xml
	      ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2014/ParlaMint-BE_2014-06-30.xml
	      ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2014/ParlaMint-BE_2014-07-17.xml
	      ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2015/ParlaMint-BE_2015-01-06-54.xml
	      ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2015/ParlaMint-BE_2015-01-07-54.xml
	      ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2015/ParlaMint-BE_2015-01-08-54.xml
	    </eg>
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <div xml:id="sec-roottags">
            <head>Attributes of top-level elements</head>
	    
	    <p>The Section on <ref target="#sec-overall">Overall corpus structure</ref>
	    introduced the top level (root) elements of the corpus root file and of the
	    component files (i.e. the <gi>teiCorpus</gi> and <gi>TEI</gi> elements), but did
	    not elaborate on their attribtues; these are presented in this section.</p>

	    <p>Both elements have the same required attributes, as shown below on a corpus
	    root tag:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-teiCorpus">
              <![CDATA[<teiCorpus xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="ParlaMint-FR" xml:lang="fr">]]>
	    </egXML>
	    All three three attributes can also be used on any other element, and are thus of
	    special importance:
	    <list>
	      <item><att>xmlns</att> determines the namespace of the element, and this should
	      always be the TEI namespace, i.e. <code>http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0</code>. Note
	      that all lower level elements in the same file inherit this namespace, so it is
	      not necessary (although it is not an error) for other elements to also define
	      their namespace.</item>
	      
	      <item><att>xml:id</att> is an attribute form the XML namespace, and gives the
	      identifier for the corpus root or component.  The value should be unique in the
	      corpus as a whole.  For the corpus root and component files it is required that
	      this top level identifier is identical to the file name (without the file
	      extension). <att>xml:id</att> is a global attribute, so any element can have
	      it. While this is not required, it is necessary for any element that is then
	      referred to (via this same ID) by some other element, such as many elements in
	      the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, as is explained in the Section on <ref
	      target="#sec-metadata">Corpus metadata</ref>.</item>
	      
	      <item><att>xml:lang</att> is also a global attribute and gives the language code
	      of the text content of the element. The convention is that language of the text
	      content of an element is determined by the value of the first
	      <att>xml:lang</att> attribute on it ancestor axis. In cases where the content is
	      multilingual, the language code should be of the majority language. When the
	      proportion of the languages is about equal, then the <q>mul</q> code for
	      multiple languages should be used.</item>
	    </list>
	    </p>	    
	  </div>
	</div>
	
	<div xml:id="sec-metadata">
          <head>Corpus metadata</head>
	  
          <p>As mentioned, <gi>teiCorpus</gi> and <gi>TEI</gi> elements contain the obligatory
          <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, which stores the metadata to the corpus root or
          component. In this section we explain and give examples of the required and optional
          metadata that is contained in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, proceeding through its various
          elements, and there distinguishing which parts and what content is appropriate for
          the corpus root, and which for a corpus component.</p>

	  <p>As a general remark, most metadata contains free text, and it is a requirement of
	  ParlaMint that this data is given in the English language, to help researchers for
	  other countries to understand it, but also in the local language in which the (main
	  portion of) parliamentary transcripts is written, in order for local researcher to
	  be able to use it in their native tongue.</p>

	  <p>A ParlaMint <gi>teiHeader</gi> contains three obligatory elements: the file
	  description, <gi>fileDesc</gi>, the encoding description, <gi>encodingDesc</gi>, and
	  the profile description, <gi>profileDesc</gi>, and an optional revision description,
	  <gi>revisionDesc</gi>:

              </titleStmt>
	    </egXML>
	    The title statement starts with two titles (one main, the other subordinate), both
	    in English and the local language, with the appropriate language code possibly
	    inherited from a superordinate element. They are distinguished by the value
	    <code>main</code> or <code>sub</code> of their <att>type</att> attribute and the
	    value of their <att>xml:lang</att> attribute.</p>
	    
	    <p>The main title has a formulaic structure <q>&lt;Country name&gt; parliamentary
	    corpus ParlaMint-&lt;Country code&gt; [ParlaMint]</q>, with an equivalent
	    structure for the local language. Note that the corpus <q>stamp</q> in square
	    brackets can also be <q>[ParlaMint.ana]</q> for the linguistically annotated
	    version of the corpus (further explained in the Section on <ref
	    target="#sec-linguistic">Linguistic annotation</ref>) or <q>[ParlaMint SAMPLE]</q>
	    for corpus data samples, as available on the <ref
	    target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/">ParlaMint GitHub
	    repository</ref>.</p>

	    <p>The subordinate title, in contrast to the main one, is free text, and usually
	    formed on the basis of the source of the corpus. As with the main one, it should
	    be given in both languages.</p>

	    <p>After the titles come the specification of the particular sessions that the
	    corpus contains, encoded as <gi>meeting</gi> elements: in free text, the two
	    meeting elements in the above example state that the ParlaMint-SI corpus contains
	    the meetings of the 7th and 8th terms of the lower house of the National Assembly
	    of the Republic of Slovenia. In terms of encoding, these elements can give, as the
	    value of their <att>n</att> attribute the number of the - in the case above -
	    meetings that the corpus covers, and their text content can give a free-text
	    description of the terms in the local language. The formal information is given in
	    the values of the <att>corresp</att> and <att>ana</att> attributes. These are
	    pointing attributes, and they refer to the appropriate elements given in other
	    parts of the corpus root header, in particular the definition of organisations
	    further explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-orgs">Party and other
	    organisational metadata</ref> and the categories of taxonomy elements, further
	    explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-classDecl">The class
	    declaration</ref>. The value of the <att>corresp</att> attribute points to the
	    governmental body of which a particular meeting element is a meeting of (in this
	    case the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia), while the <att>ana</att>
	    attribute contains a space-delimited sequence of pointers:
	    <code>#parla.lower</code> points to the definition of the lower house,
	    <code>#parla.term</code> to the definition of a parliamentary term, and
	    <code>#DZ.7</code> to the definition of the seventh mandate.
	    <!-- This is silly, why two attributes, why DZ in one, lowe in the other?? Issue? -->
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>Next come one or more responsibility statements, <gi>respStmt</gi>, each one
	    containing one or more person names, <gi>persName</gi>, with an optional
	    <att>ref</att> attribute, giving the URL, where more information about the person
	    can be found, and the responsibility element <gi>resp</gi>, which specifies what
	    responsiblity the statement is about; as usual, the responsibility should be both
	    in the local language and in English.</p>

	    <p>In a similar manner, the <gi>funder</gi> elements give information on the
	    organisations which have financially contributed to the compilation of the corpus,
	    with the names of the organisations given in the <gi>orgName</gi> elements.</p>
	    
	    <p>A corpus component has a very similar title statement to the corpus root,
	    except that certain elements specify the metadata of the component, rather than
	    the complete corpus. Unlike with most other elements in the component header, we
	    here also have some redundant metadata, in particular the responsibility statement
	    and the funder, as illustrated in the example below:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-titleStmtComp">
	      <titleStmt>
		<title type="main">Slovenski parlamentarni korpus ParlaMint-SI, izredna seja 59 [ParlaMint]</title>

	      </titleStmt>
	    </egXML>
	    In the example it can be seen that the main title of a corpus component is simply
	    an extension of the corpus root title, as it also gives the name of the particular
	    meeting that the component contains, while the subordinate title is, again, free
	    text. Both titles must be unique in the complete corpus.</p>

	    <p>The other difference is in the <gi>meeting</gi> elements, which here specify a
	    particular meeting, in this case an extraordinary meeting of the lower house in
	    the seventh term of the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	    
	  <div xml:id="sec-editionStmt">
            <head>The edition statement</head>
	    <p>ParlaMint corpora have their edition statement, <gi>editionStmt</gi> both in
	    the corpus root and components. As illustrated below, the only element it contains
	    is <gi>edition</gi>:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-editionStmt">
              <editionStmt>
		<edition>2.1</edition>
              </editionStmt>
	    </egXML>
	    We use semantic versioning to specify the version of the corpus, i.e giving the
	    version number, where a new version means substantial changes to the corpus, while
	    the minor version is reserved for e.g. correcting errata or other minor
	    changes. We do not use the patch number. It should be noted that - at least so far
	    - all the ParlaMint corpora were released together, so that they are all of the
	    same edition, i.e. have the same version number. At the time of writing, the
	    latest version is 2.1, with the next one planned to be 3.0.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div xml:id="sec-extent">
            <head>The extent</head>
	    
	    <p>The <gi>extent</gi> element gives information on selected sizes of the
	    complete corpus (in the corpus root) or of one corpus component, as illustrated
	    below in the case of a corpus root extent:
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-fileDesc">
              <extent>
		<measure unit="speeches" quantity="75122" xml:lang="sl">75.122 govorov</measure>
		<measure unit="speeches" quantity="75122" xml:lang="en">75,122 speeches</measure>
		<measure unit="words" quantity="20190034" xml:lang="sl">20.190.034 besed</measure>
		<measure unit="words" quantity="20190034" xml:lang="en">20,190,034 words</measure>
              </extent>
	    </egXML>
	    ParlaMint requires two sizes to be given, and in both languages, which are
	    distinguished by their <att>unit</att> attribute, namely the number of speeches
	    and the number of words. The exact quantitiy is given in the <att>quantity</att>
	    attribute, while the text content of <gi>measure</gi> gives the quantity together
	    with the with the unit - if possible, the number here should contain the thousands
	    separator appropriate for the language.</p>

	    <p>It should be noted that both sizes are somewhat complex to compute and are
	    inserted into the TEI headers in the finalisation of a corpus (cf. the Section on
	    <ref target="#sec-conversion">Validation and conversion</ref>) by a common script,
	    so it is not necessary insert the extent in the process of developing a ParlaMint
	    corpus.</p>

	  <div xml:id="sec-publicationStmt">

	    <p>The publication statement <gi>publicationStmt</gi> must appear in the corpus

	    below, it contains information about the publisher of the corpus, the persistent

              Declaration</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, by using the <gi>taxonomy</gi> element. To illusrate,
              we give below the start of a speaker-type taxonomy:

          <head>Speaker metadata</head>
          <p>Unlike some other proposals, in particular Akoma Ntoso, the Parla-CLARIN recommendations
          assume that speaker meta-data is also included in the corpus,<note>Of course, this
          does not meant that links with corpus-external URIs are not allowed.</note> as
          this allows the corpus to be stand-alone with all the relevant data necessary for
          analysis already included in it.</p>
          
          <p>Information on speakers is given in the corpus TEI header, in particular in the
          <gi>listPerson</gi> element, itself a part of the participant description,
          i.e. the <gi>particDesc</gi> element.</p>

          <p>A <gi>listPerson</gi> typically contains <gi>person</gi> elements, which give
          information on an individual person, as the example below illustrates.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-speakers">
            <person xml:id="KučanMilan1">
              <persName>
                <forename>Milan</forename>
                <surname>Kučan</surname>
              </persName>
              <sex value="M">male</sex>
              <birth when="1941-01-14">
                <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3197229">Križevci</placeName>
              </birth>
            </person>
          </egXML>

          Each <gi>person</gi> must have an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so that it can be referred
          to from the transcription. Apart from that, the only required element is
          <gi>persName</gi>, giving the name of the person. This can be contained directly in the
          element, or, as the preferred option, further decomposed into the person surname(s) and
          forename(s) or even other elements, as explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPER">Personal
          Names</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

          <p>As illustrated above, further person metadata can contain the sex of the person and
          their birth date and place. Other potentially useful elements are the persons
          <gi>death</gi> date and place, as well as (possibly time stamped) <gi>education</gi>,
          <gi>occupation</gi>, and <gi>affiliation</gi>.</p>

          <p>In the context of PPCs, the <gi>affiliation</gi> element is especially important, as it
          can denote the person's membership in a political party, or their role in the parliament,
          such as being an MP. Different types of affiliations are distinguished by the different
          values of the <att>role</att> attribute, such as <q>member</q> (of a party) or <q>MP</q>.
          As affiliations are not necessarily fixed, and the <gi>affiliation</gi> element can
          be marked for its temporal duration, as explained in the Section on
	  <ref target="#sec-temporal">Temporal information</ref>.
	  The example below illustrates the encoding of various affiliations.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-affiliation">
            <person xml:id="AnderličAnton">
              <persName>
                <surname>Anderlič</surname>
                <forename>Anton</forename>
              </persName>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#party.ZSMS" from="1990-05-08" to="1990-11-09"/>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#party.LDS.1" from="1990-11-10" to="1994-03-11"/>
              <affiliation role="MP" ref="#DruzPolZb" from="1990-05-08" to="1992-12-22" ana="#SK.11"/>
              <affiliation role="MP" ref="#DZ" from="1992-12-23" to="1996-11-27" ana="#DZ.1"/>
	    </person>
          </egXML>
	  </p>
	  
          <p>The example above uses, via the <att>ref</att> attribute, stand-off annotation to refer
          to the names of the parties, which should then be defined in a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element in
          the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, as explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-party">Party
          metadata</ref>. The same can be done for the MP affiliation to the national assembly,
          where, additionally, a reference, via the <att>ana</att> attribute, is given to the
          legislative period in which the person was an MP.</p>

	  <p>Alternatively (or additionally), the name of the party or national assembly can also be
	  given directly in the <gi>affiliation</gi> element using the <gi>orgName</gi> element, as
	  illustrated below. The example also illustrates the additional information, encoded as a
	  subordinate <gi>affiliation</gi> with the appropriate <att>role</att>, that the person was
	  elected as an MP to represent a certain constituency, giving its name and location.
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-constituency">
            <affiliation role="MP" ref="#DruzPolZb" from="1990-05-08" to="1996-11-27">

              <orgName xml:lang="en">National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia</orgName>
	      <affiliation role="consituency">
                <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/3194351">Novo mesto</placeName>
	      </affiliation>
	    </affiliation>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Persons can have further attributes, and TEI offers various elements (typically typed)
          to express them; they are introduced in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSEpc">Personal
          Characteristics</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The two more general ones are <gi>state</gi>,
          which contains the description of some status or quality attributed to a person (or
          organisation), often at some specific time or for a specific date range and <gi>trait</gi>,
          which differs from <gi>state</gi> that it is independent of the volition or action of the
          holder and usually not at some specific time or for a specific date range. The former
          could, for example, be used to encode the fact that a PM was jailed for a given period of
          time, while the latter would e.g. be used for the information that a PM is handicapped.</p>

          <p>It is often advantageous to refer to external knowledge sources about a person, such as
          Wikipedia or VIAF. This is encoded using the <gi>idno</gi> element, whose content is
          typically a URI, while the <att>type</att> attribute denotes the kind of knowledge source
          referred to.

          <p>Information on political parties, as well as other groupings of people, such as
          ministries, is contained in the <gi>listOrg</gi> element, which is, just as
          <gi>listPerson</gi> element, contained in the <gi>particDesc</gi> element of the

          As with persons, each organisation must contain an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so
          that <gi>person</gi> elements can refer to it. The fact that the organisation is a
          political party is encoded in the <att>role</att> attribute, where the suggested
          values are defined in the Parla-CLARIN schema. The name(s) of the party are given in
          the <gi>orgName</gi> element, which also uses the <att>full</att> attribute to
          distinguish between the full name of the part and the initials of the party. Parties
          are also created and dissolved, and can also change their name.  The former is
          indicated by the <gi>event</gi> element, which, in the example above, we have typed
          as "existence" and where the dates of its existence are given in the <att>from</att>
          and <att>to</att> attributes. The same attributes on the <gi>orgName</gi> elements
          indicate the temporal duration of the parties names.<note>Note that there can exist a
          date where both names are valid names of the party - it is up to the processing
          software to make sense of this situation.</note></p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-relation">
          <head>Relationships between people and parties</head>
          
          <p>It is also possible to encode relations between people and parties, e.g. kinship between
          MPs, or that one party is the successor of another one. For this purpose, TEI defines the
          <gi>listRelation</gi> element explained in detail in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSREL">Personal
          Relationships</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. This element can be contained by the
          <gi>listPerson</gi> or <gi>listOrg</gi> elements and, in turn, contains the
          <gi>relation</gi> elements, each of which defines one relation. The example below shows a
          relation between people.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatpers">
            <relation name="parent" passive="#sbi243926" active="#sbi243926-0 #sbi243926-1"/>
          </egXML>

          The relation defines the relationship "parent" between the <att>active</att> persons of
          this relationship (i.e. those defined in the <gi>person</gi> element with the
          <att>xml:id</att> values of <val>sbi243926-0</val> and <val>sbi243926-1</val>) and the
          <att>passive</att> person of this relationship (i.e. the <gi>person</gi> element with the
          <att>xml:id</att> value of <val>sbi243926</val>).</p>

          <p>Relationships can also be mutual, e.g. in the case of spouses, as illustrated below
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatmutual">
            <relation name="spouse" mutual="#sbi243926 #sbi243929"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Relationship can also exist between parties (i.e. organisations), for example the
          fact that one party is a successor of another. This can be expressed as in the
          example below.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-succparty">
            <relation name="successor" passive="#pp.SDZ" active="#pp.DS"/>
          </egXML>

          Another example is the set of parties that make up the coalition or opposition in
          a given time interval. As shown below, a coalition is also encoded as a
          <gi>relation</gi>, where the references to the parties comprising it are encoded
          in the <att>mutual</att> attribute. In contrast, the opposition <gi>relation</gi>
          distinguishes the <att>active</att> parties which comprise it, and the
          <att>passive</att> pointer to the definition of the government to which the
          parties are opposed:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatorg-simple">
            <listRelation>
              <relation name="coalition"
                        mutual="#party.S #party.F"
                        from="2013-05-23"
                        to="2017-01-10"/>
              <relation name="opposition"
                        active="#party.Vg #party.Bf #party.V #party.P #party.Sf"
                        passive="#GOV_LV"
                        from="2013-05-23"
                        to="2017-01-10"/>
            </listRelation>
          </egXML>

          If a coalition or opposition needs to have more information associated with it,
          e.g. its name, then a more complex encoding needs to be used, as illustrated
          below. Here all the information about the coalition (i.e. an <gi>org</gi> of
          <att>type</att> coalition) is encoded in a <gi>listOrg</gi> element, which then
          defines the name of the coalition, followed by its <gi>listRelation</gi>, as
          before.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatorg-complex">
            <listOrg>
              <org xml:id="cl.DEMOS" role="coalition">
                <orgName full="init">DEMOS</orgName>
              </org>
              <listRelation>
                <relation type="coalition"
                          pasive="#cl.DEMOS"
                          active="#pp.SDZ #pp.SDSS #pp.SKD #pp.SKZ #pp.SOS #pp.ZS"/>
              </listRelation>
            </listOrg>
          </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div xml:id="sec-transcript">
        <head>Transcriptions</head>
        
          <p>In the text <gi>body</gi> the element that further organises the content
          into sections is the division, <gi>div</gi>, and each of the three
          text-bearing elements (if present) should contain at least one division.</p>
	
          <p>The divisions can be nested, as shown in the example below:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-divsimple">
            <body>
              <div>
                ...
                <div>
                  <head>Representation of members of the Federal Government</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Hour of topical interest</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Announcement of an urgent request</head>
                  ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </body>
          </egXML>
          In general it is a complicated question what should constitute a division of a
          transcription, with the pragmatic solution being that a division will be whatever has
          a heading (than can be recognised by the up-conversion software) in the source
          transcription.</p>

          <p>If used, the values of the <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes will
          depend on the parliamentary rules of the particular country, on the need to
          distinguish the types of divisions, as well as on the ability to automatically
          recognise them or the available effort to manually add them. The Parla-CLARIN
          specification does therefore not enforce the use of these attributes nor does it
          restrict their values.  However, the definition of <gi>div</gi> does give a set of
          sample values for <att>type</att>, which correspond to the names of the structure
          elements defined by <ref target="#sec-akoma">Akoma Ntoso</ref>. Below we give an
          example of a relatively complex structure made on the basis of an Akoma

        <p>The transcriptions of the parliamentary debates are the central part of these
        recommendations and this section explains how to encode the transcriptions of
        speeches proper, and how to treat the commentary inserted by the
        transcribers, which often marks various verbal and non-verbal incidents, such
        as applause, interruption of speeches, voting (with results) etc.  Most of
        these elements are explained in the Chapter on <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html">Transcription
        of Speech</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and we illustrate the essential ones
        below.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-uterrance">
          <head>Utterances</head>
          <p>A speech is marked up using the <gi>u</gi> (utterance) element, as illustrated below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-speech">
            <u who="#DavidPrior" ana="#regular">
              <seg>I ask that the draft Regulations laid before the House on 5 December be approved.</seg>
              <seg>The relevant document is the 20th Report from the Legislation Committee.</seg>
            </u>
          </egXML>
          
          The main attribute of an utterance is <att>who</att>, which gives the pointer to the
          <gi>person</gi> element containing the metadata of the speaker. The <gi>u</gi>
          element can also have the <att>ana</att> attribute giving one or more pointers to a
          typology of types of speakers. In our case, it would point to a category that
          specifies that the speaker is a regular speaker (rather than, e.g., the chair) of the
          session.</p>
          
          <p>The utterances can (but are not required to) be segmented using the generic
          TEI element for segments, <gi>seg</gi>, which encodes the paragraphs of the source
          transcription.<note>The reason why the TEI element for paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) is not
          used is that utterances, being essentially (transcriptions of) spoken text, do not
          allow for internal paragraphs, a concept pertinent more to written text.</note></p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-comments">
          <head>Transcriber comments</head>
          
          <p>Transcriber comments encode information such as interruptions, notes on
          what is happening in the chamber, results of voting, etc.
          Note that while section headings can also be taken as a kind of transcriber comments, these
          serve to structure a document, and are therefore treated in the Section on
          <ref target="#sec-textstruct">Text divisions</ref>.</p>

          <p>In general, transcriber comments are encoded using <gi>note</gi>, although some
          comments can be encoded using more precise TEI elements, as explained below.  Whether
          <gi>note</gi> or these more specific elements will be used, and, indeed, whether
          comments are preserved in the encoding at all, will depend on the needs and resources
          of each particular project.</p>

          <p>The example below lists some typically transcriber comments, which are here further
          qualified by their <att>type</att> attribute:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-notes">
            <note type="speaker">The president, Dr. Milan Brglez:</note>
            <note type="time">The sesssion began at 10 o'clock.</note>
            <note type="vote-ayes">84 voted for the adotion of the measure.</note>
            <note type="vote-noes">2 voted against the adotion of the measure.</note>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>The first note simply gives the speaker of the utterance that would follow it, the
          second one gives the time when the session started, while the third and fourth are
          notes on the voting results. Note that in all three cases, instead of, or in addition
          to retaining such notes, the information contained in them can also be further
          explicated in dedicated markup. So, the information given in the first note will
          typically be encoded in the <att>who</att> attribute, the second could be
          encoded in the <code>u/@when</code> attribute, while how to encode the last two is
          explained in the Section on <ref target="sec-voting">Voting results</ref>.  It is
          therefore a matter of editorial policy whether to faithfully reproduce the
          transcription, including comments, or whether to remove the comments when they have
          already been taken into account when processing the transcriptions.</p>

          <p>Some types of transcriber comments can also be encoded using more specific TEI
          elements than <gi>note</gi>.
          In particular, the TEI module for Transcription of Speech (<q><ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html#TSBA">Elements
          unique to spoken texts</ref></q>) defines the following <q>incident</q>
          elements that correspond to various types of transcriber's comments:
          <list>
            <item><gi>vocal</gi> marks any vocalized but not necessarily lexical phenomenon,
            e.g. laughter, sounds of (dis)agreement from the benches etc.</item>
            <item><gi>kinesic</gi> marks any communicative phenomenon, not necessarily
            vocalized, for example clapping, a gesture or frown, etc.</item>
            <item><gi>incident</gi> marks any phenomenon or occurrence, not necessarily
            vocalized or communicative, for example incidental noises or other events
            affecting communication.</item>
          </list>
          
          The example below illustrates the use of these three elements:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-incidents">
            <u xml:lang="sl" who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika">With this I disolve the parliament!</u>
            <vocal who="#opposition"><desc xml:lang="en">shouting</desc></vocal>
            <kinesic who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika"><desc xml:lang="en">banging the gavel</desc></kinesic>
            <incident><desc xml:lang="en">army storms the parliament</desc></incident>
            <kinesic who="#governmet"><desc xml:lang="en">clapping</desc></kinesic>
          </egXML>
          
	  As the example shows, the content of the transcriber comment is retained in the
	  <gi>desc</gi> element, while the <att>who</att> attribute can be used to specify who
	  is responsible for the incident. All three elements can also be further qualified using their
          <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes.
          </p>

          <p>It should be noted that <gi>note</gi> and the four <q>incident</q> elements
          can be placed either on the same level as the <gi>u</gi> elements, or directly
          inside them (so, on the same level as <gi>seg</gi> elements) or even inside
          <gi>seg</gi> elements. It is recommended to place them as far up the hierarchy as
          possible, and especially avoid having them inside elements with otherwise contain
          text only (i.e. utterances or segments), as placing elements there leads to mixed
          content, which is difficult to process further, in particular if the text is to
          be linguistically annotated. However, if a transcriber comment is placed in the
          middle of the text, then it needs to be encoded inside the utterance, except if
          the utterance is split, as is further explained in the Section on <ref
          target="#sec-interruptions">Interrupted utterances</ref>.</p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-gaps">
          <head>Gaps</head>

	  <p>The transcribers can also comment that a part of the speech was not
	  transcribed, e.g. because the recording was not understood, sometimes also noting
	  the reason why, such as that the microphone was not turned on, that there was
	  noise in the chamber, or that the speaker was speaking too quietly. These notes
	  can be encoded as the <gi>gap</gi> element, which is then also marked by
	  <att>reason</att>=<val>inaudible</val>.  The original transcriber note can be
	  left in the <gi>desc</gi> element, as illustrated below.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-gap">
	    ... I would further state that
	    <gap reason="inaudible">
	      <desc>Microphone off</desc>
	    </gap>
	    and furthermore ....
          </egXML>
	  </p>

	  <p>The other reason for omitting a part of the transcription can be an editorial
	  decision of the corpus compilers. The transcript can, for example, contain
	  material that they do not want to include in the corpus, such as tables, or
	  parts of the transcription that cannot be converted to text. In these cases, the
	  reason given should be "editorial", while the <gi>desc</gi> should contain what
	  has been omitted, as illustrated below.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-gap-editorial">
            <gap reason="editorial">
              <desc xml:lang="en">Table omitted</desc>
            </gap>
          </egXML>
	  </p>

	</div>
	
        <div xml:id="sec-interruptions">
          <head>Interrupted utterances</head>
          <p>A special case occurs when a transcription note states that somebody interrupted
          the speaker and gives the transcript of the interruption, with the main speaker
          then continuing with their speech, as in the following snippet:
          
          <eg>Boris Johnson: I propose a no-deal Brexit. /Jeremy Corbyn: Traitor!/ Because 
          England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</eg>
          
          While the interruption might be simply encoded as a <gi>note</gi> or
          <gi>vocal</gi> element, as explained above, it is more precisely encoded as a
          separate utterance, which brings with it the problem that nested utterances are
          not allowed, so the main utterance then needs to be split into two (or more)
          pieces. The example below illustrates how this is encoded:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-splitu">
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.3" next="#GB001.8.5">I propose a no-deal Brexit.</u>
            <u who="#JeremyCorbyn" xml:id="GB001.8.4">Traitor!</u>
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.5" prev="#GB001.8.3">Because England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</u>
          </egXML>
          
          As can be seen, the split is indicated by the use of the <att>next</att>
          attribute on the first part of the split utterance and by the <att>prev</att>
          attribute of the next part of the split utterance. The values of the attributes
          are pointers to the next of previous identifiers of the appropriate part of the
          split utterance.<note>Note that, in general, the utterance can also be split in
          the middle of a sentence, which brings with it problems for automatic linguistic
          processing, as, ideally, the parts should be first joined, and only then
          processed.</note></p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-qa">
          <head>Addressees, questions and answers</head>
	  <p>Sometimes particular speeches are in fact questions (or statements) addressed to a
	  person, or answers to particular questions, again, directed at the person that posed the
	  question, and it might be advantageous to encode this fact. The encoding of a question and
	  answer, and to whom it is directed is illustrated below.
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-qa">
            <u xml:id="q_1" who="#kappa" toWhom="#eta" ana="#question">
              <seg>I would like to ask the Mr. Eta about ...</seg>
            </u>
            <u xml:id="a_1" who="#eta" toWhom="#kappa" ana="#answer">
              <seg>Mr. Kappa, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for ...</seg>
            </u>
          </egXML>
	  
	  The person at whom a speech is directed is encoded in the <att>toWhom</att> attribute on
	  the <gi>u</gi> element, which is, same as <att>who</att>, a reference which must point to a
	  defined person. For the fact that the first speech is a question, and the second an
	  answer, we here presuppose a taxonomy in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> of the corpus, which
	  defines the types of utterances we wish to distinguish, and the <val>question</val> and
	  <val>answer</val> are IDs of the appropriate categories.
          </p>
	</div>
	
        <div xml:id="sec-voting">
          <head>Voting results</head>
          <p>One further aspects of the transcripts, which can be of particular interest for
          some researchers, needs to be mentioned, namely voting results. Voting results are
          typically mentioned in the transcripts as a note, and we follow Akoma Ntoso in its
          treatment. Assuming a <gi>taxonomy</gi> in the TEI header that defines "ayes" and
          "noes", the note can be marked up using the <gi>measure</gi> element, as the
          following example shows:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-voting1">
            <note type="summary">(Question carried by
            <measure xml:id="quantity_1" corresp="#ayes" quantity="72">72</measure> to
            <measure xml:id="quantity_2" corresp="#noes" quantity="56">56</measure>
            votes)</note>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>In addition to marking up the voting results in-line, they can also be more
          formally encoding at the start of the <gi>body</gi>, using the <gi>listEvent</gi>
          element to contain the list of individual votes in the <gi>event</gi> elements. Below
          we give a more complicated example, where the voting was followed by a recount, and
          this fact is encoded in the <gi>relation</gi> element, of course, again assuming the
          appropriate taxonomies in the teiHeader:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-voting2">

	<div>
          <p>However, as such URIs can be very long, TEI also offers another way of pointing, which
	  can be used to shorten such long URIs, and this is defined by the <gi>prefixDef</gi>
	  element in the TEI header, as illustrated below:

	  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-prefixDef">
            <prefixDef ident="mte" matchPattern="(.+)"

            </prefixDef>
          </egXML>

	  With such a definition, we can use much shorter pointers in the markup of words,
	  such as <val>mte:Pd-nsg</val>, which are then, via a regular expression mapping in the
	  prefix definition, converted to the full URI <val>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml#Pd-nsg</val>.
          </p>

        <div xml:id="sec-idents">
          <head>Identifiers and referencing</head>
          <p>In order to simply refer to elements of a TEI document (i.e. a Parla-CLARIN
          corpus), elements can be marked with an ID, i.e. given the <att>xml:id</att> attribute
          with a unique value, obeying certain format requirements as defined by
          <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">W3C</ref>.</p>
          
          <p>Parla-CLARIN requires an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on the root element of
          each corpus file, which should, furthermore, be identical to the filename (modulo
          the file extension).  Parla-CLARIN also recommends that the divisions of the
          document (element <gi>div</gi>) should also be given identifiers. While any
          element can be given an <att>xml:id</att>, this is, in general, not a good idea;
          rather, only those elements that will or could be referenced should be marked with
          this attribute.</p>
          
          <p>TEI offers a number of attributes that contain (URI) pointers.  Where the reference
          is to an element inside the document, the value of the <att>xml:id</att> being
          referred to should be preceded by a hash (#), as mandated by the XML standard. If the
          ID pointed to is from another document, then the full URI needs to be used.</p>

<div>
	<!-- Metadata section! -->
	  <p>It is good practice to document the languages used in the <gi>langUsage</gi>

        <p>This section introduces basic types of linguistic annotation that can be added
        to PPCs; the examples should be sufficient for users to be able to add further types
        of linguistic annotation to PPC corpora.</p>
        
        <p>It is recommended that linguistically annotated PPCs are stored in two
        versions, one with the linguistic annotations, and the other without
        them. The reason for this is that many users prefer to use the
        <q>plain-text</q> version, e.g. because they want to perform their own
        linguistic annotation, or this kind of annotation is simply not relevant for
        their research questions.</p>
        
        <p>The TEI Guidelines discuss basic linguistic annotation in their Chapter on <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html">Simple Analytic
        Mechanisms</ref> and we follow one particular option given there. In particular, it is
        recommended that (where possible) the annotation is in-line (as opposed to stand-off),
        i.e. that the linguistic annotation is given in the main document, and therefore mixed
        with the other annotations, rather than in a separate document with pointers into the
        base text.</p>
        
	<div>
        <p>When automatic procedures have been used to encode the texts (most prominently, to
          add linguistic markup, as discussed in the Section on <ref
          target="#sec-linguistic">Linguistic annotation</ref>) this should be documented in
          the <gi>appInfo</gi> element of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi>, as shown in the example
          below:

          <p>Basic linguistic annotation comprises sentence segmentation, tokenisation,
          part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation. The Parla-CLARIN recommendations
          specialise the recommendations given in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILALW">Lightweight
          Linguistic Annotation</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The following example shows the
          basic principles of the annotation:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-ud">

              <pc msd="UPosTag=PUNCT">.</pc>
            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Sentences are marked up using the <gi>s</gi> element, words with the <gi>w</gi>
          element and punctuation symbols with the <gi>pc</gi> element. To retain the
          linguistically significant whitespace, the <att>join</att> element is used, with the
          possible values being <val>no</val> (assumed to be the default), <val>right</val>
          (no whitespace to the right of the token) and <val>left</val> (no whitespace to the
          left of the token) and <val>both</val> (no whitespace to either side of the
          token). While, in the preceding example, it would be more intuitive to have the
          value <val>left</val> marked on the full-stop, we recommend that only the value
          <val>right</val> is used on the preceding token, as this simplifies processing.</p>
          
          <p>The base form of a word is given in the <att>lemma</att> attribute,<note>Note
          that punctuation characters, <gi>pc</gi>, do not have a <att>lemma</att> attribute,
          as they cannot sensibly be said to have lemmas.</note> while the situation with the
          part-of-speech tags is somewhat more complicated. For analytic tagsets, where a
          "part-of-speech tag" is actually a set of attribute-values, as in the example above,
          the <att>msd</att> attribute should be used. For synthetic tagsets, such as the <ref
          target="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn
          Treebank tagset</ref>, which have atomic tags that cannot always be decomposed into
          attribute-value pairs (e.g. "TO" for the word "to"), a better alternative is to use
          of the <att>pos</att> attribute.</p>

	  <p>There is also a third option, for tags that are look like strings, however, they
	  are meant as a shorthand for a feature-structure representation, as is the case with
	  the <ref target="http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/html/">MULTEXT-East tagset</ref>. For
	  these, it is best to use the generic <att>ana</att> attribute, whose value is a
	  pointer, as shown in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-msd">
            <s>
              <w ana="#Pd-nsg" lemma="ta">Tega</w>
              <w ana="#Px------y" lemma="se">se</w>
              <w ana="#Q" lemma="sploh">sploh</w>
              <w ana="#Va-r1s-y" lemma="biti">nisem</w>
              <w ana="#Vmep-sm" lemma="zavesti" join="right">zavedel</w>
              <pc ana="#Z">.</pc>
            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Here, the tags are pointers to identifiers, where the elements bearing these
          identifiers define the appropriate feature-structures, i.e. pairs of
          attribute-values, as in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-fs">
            <fs xml:id="Pd-nsg" xml:lang="en">
              <f name="CATEGORY"><symbol value="Pronoun"/></f>
              <f name="Type"><symbol value="demonstrative"/></f>
              <f name="Gender"><symbol value="neuter"/></f>
              <f name="Number"><symbol value="singular"/></f>
              <f name="Case"><symbol value="genitive"/></f>
            </fs>
          </egXML>
          </p>

	  <p>Such feature structures are grouped together in the feature-value library
	  (<gi>fvLib</gi>) element, which can be contained in its own <gi>TEI</gi> element of
	  the corpus. As <att>ana</att> is a pointer, it can also contain complete URLs
	  (e.g. <code>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib2-sl.xml#Pd-nsg</code>) which
	  enables the feature-structure definitions to be stored externaly to the
	  corpus. However, prefixing such PoS tags for each token by the complete URL would
	  lead to very large files. This is why the TEI offers a mechanism to shorten 
	  references to URLs. This mechanism is explained in the Section <ref
	  target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SAPU">Using
	  Abbreviated Pointers</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and we give below and example:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-prefix">
            <s>
              <w ana="mte:Pd-nsg" lemma="ta">Tega</w>
              <w ana="mte:Px------y" lemma="se">se</w>
              <w ana="mte:Q" lemma="sploh">sploh</w>
              <w ana="mte:Va-r1s-y" lemma="biti">nisem</w>
              <w ana="mte:Vmep-sm" lemma="zavesti" join="right">zavedel</w>
              <pc ana="mte:Z">.</pc>
            </s>
          </egXML>
	  
	  As can be seen, the only difference to the preceding example is that the values (IDs) of
	  the tags are preceded by <code>mte:</code> rather than <code>#</code>. This prefix should
	  be then expanded by the processing software to whatever the <gi>prefixDef</gi> element,
	  defined in the TEI header, specifies, as shown in the example below:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-prefixDef">
            <prefixDef ident="mte"

          <head>Normalised and syntactic words</head>
          
          <p>In certain contexts a word (or, in general, a token) in the transcription needs to be
          normalised in a certain way. In the context of PPCs, this can happen with historical
          transcripts, which contain archaic wordforms and where we wish to annotate them with
          their modernised forms, or when the transcript is linguistically annotated, and the
          annotation framework distinguishes original words form syntactic words (i.e. has the
          concept of <q>multiwords</q>), as is the case in the <ref
          target="https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#words-tokens-and-empty-nodes">Universal
          Dependencies framework</ref>.</p>
	  
	  <p>For simple normalisation, where a one-word token is normalised into another word token,
	  the <att>norm</att> attribute on word or punctuation tokens should be used, as explained
	  at the end of the Section <ref
	  target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILALW">Lightweight
	  Linguistic Annotation</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

	  <p>More challenging is the case where one original word token must be represented as
	  several normalised words, either in the context of historical corpora or, as mentioned
	  above, in the context of multiword units. For this, we use embedded empty words with
	  associated <att>norm</att> attributes, and possibly other attributes with linguistic
	  annotation. For example, Czech has the word <q>abyste</q> which is decomposed into two
	  syntactic words, <q>aby</q> and <q>byste</q>. This should be encoded as in the following
	  example:<note>Note that the example is rendered in three lines, however, the correct
	  encoding in the corpus is actually in a single line, without any spaces between the
	  elements, as otherwise the new line and indenting spaces are actually a part of the word
	  <q>abyste</q>.</note>

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-1-2">
	    <w>abyste
            <w norm="aby" lemma="aby"/>
            <w norm="byste" lemma="být"/>
            </w>
          </egXML>
	  </p>
	  
          <p>There are also cases where two (or more) original words correspond to one normalised
          word. Here, it is the outer word that carries the <att>norm</att> and possibly other
          linguistic attributes, while the inner words are the original ones. For example, Slovene
          used to form the superlative form of adjectives with the word <q>naj</q> written
          separately (and often as <q>nar</q>), while in contemporary Slovene the <q>naj</q> is a
          prefix of the adjective. This case should be encoded as follows:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-2-1">
	    <w norm="najlepši" lemma="lep"><w>nar</w> <w>lepši</w></w>

          <head>Segmental annotation</head>
          
          <p>A common annotation type, used e.g. for marking named entities or terms, is
          segmental annotation, where a stretch of text or tokens is simply enclosed in XML
          tags, as the following example illustrates:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-names">

            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          TEI offers a number of elements that can be used for such annotations,
          e.g.:

          In the example, each token, as well as the sentence element are given an ID, and the
          first link group specifies the Universal Dependencies syntactic analysis of the
          sentence, while the second one gives its semantic role labels.  They are distinguished
          by their <att>type</att> attribute<note>We do not specify the values of
          <att>type</att> of the link gropu as the range of possibilities is too great and not
          known in advance.</note>, while the <att>targFunc</att> attribute explains the
          functions of the references given in the <att>target</att> attributes of the contained
          <gi>link</gi> elements.</p>
          
          <p>The contained links then give the references to the head and argument tokens of
          the relation, while the <att>ana</att> attribute specifies what kind of a relation
          this is. It should be noted that the value of the analysis attribute is a pointer,
          and, in the example, we use the TEI prefix mechanism, which is then expanded via the
          <gi>prefixDef</gi> element in the TEI header to resolve into a URI pointer (as
          explained in Section on <ref target="#sec-idents">Identifiers and referencing</ref>),
          most likely to pointing to <gi>taxonomy</gi> categories that give the definitions of
          the relations. A further point to notice is that the sentence serves as the Root
          element of the sentence, i.e. the fifth link of the UD analysis ties together the
          sentence with the top-most token of the sentence.</p>

        <p>Parliamentary corpora can also have data from other modalities associated with the
        transcripts, in particular audio or video recordings, and the facsimile of the original
        transcripts, particularly relevant for older parliamentary proceedings. This section
        explains how to encode such data in the TEI encoded documents, where it is assumed that
        the actual speech, video and images are stored in separate files, and the TEI document
        makes reference to them.</p>

          <p>The transcription can refer to and align with external audio and video data using
          the <gi>timeline</gi> element, explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SASYMP">Placing
          Synchronous Events in Time</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and further elaborated in

          resource management -- Transcription of spoken language</ref>. While the ISO standard
          is better elaborated, it also changes and adds element definitions, so we are using
          the standard TEI variant of speech encoding as far as the schema is concerned, while
          taking into account, as much as possible, specific encoding choices as proposed by
          the ISO standard.</p>
          
          <p>First, TEI offers the <gi>recordingStmt</gi> element (a part of <gi>fileDesc</gi>
          of the TEI header) which contains the information about the recording(s) of the
          transcription. This information can be unstructured (i.e. a series of <gi>ab</gi>
          elements) or structured (contained in the <gi>recording</gi> element); Parla-CLARIN
          recommends the structured version. As shown in the example below, the element
          contains information of the type of recording (audio / video), its duration<note>The
          <att>dur</att> values should follow the <ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#duration">W3C

          (<gi>respStmt</gi>) of the person or agency that made the recording, the date when
          the recording file was made and the equipment used:

          </p>
          
          <p>The mapping of time intervals of the recording to IDs in the TEI document is
          encoded in the <gi>timeline</gi> element, in particular in the contained
          <gi>when</gi> elements. As explained below, these IDs are then used to link elements
          in the transcription to the timeline, therefore each <gi>when</gi> element must have
          the <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The <gi>when</gi> elements must also be in the same
          order as the time-points they encode.</p>
          
          <p>As the example below shows, the timeline gives the unit in which the intervals are
          specified (typically second, <code>s</code>) and the time origin of the timeline,
          here referring to the first <gi>when</gi> element, at the very start of the
          recording, so specified with the absolute time.  Further <gi>when</gi> elements give
          the interval between this origin point and their end:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-timeline">
            <timeline unit="s" origin="#T0">
              <when xml:id="T0" absolute="00:00:00.0"/>
              <when xml:id="T1" interval="1.13" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T2" interval="3.84" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T3" interval="5.33" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T4" interval="9.35" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T5" interval="12.62" since="#T0"/>
            </timeline>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>The IDs of the timeline synchronisation are then used by the <gi>u</gi>
	  elements in the transcription via their <att>start</att> and
          <att>end</att> attributes. In the examples below we give three cases of such linking:
          the first one gives a straightforward temporal structure on the <gi>u</gi>;
	  the second one uses the
          empty <gi>anchor</gi> element to give additional temporal structure for cases where
          the synchronised parts of the utterance are not further marked-up
	  (or the synchronisation is required for elements that don't have the <att>start</att> and
          <att>end</att> attributes); while the third and
          fourth demonstrate the case where two utterances are partially overlapping:<note>Note
          that in such cases we would also use the <att>prev</att> and <att>next</att>
          attributes, as shown in the <ref target="#exa-splitu">Example on split
          utterances</ref>.</note>:

          <head>Facsimile</head>
          <p>In cases where the facsimile of the original transcription is available
          (especially valuable for older parliamentary proceedings, where the exact
          appearance of the original proceedings is of interest), it is advantageous to
          enable viewing the original together with the encoded transcription. How to
          achieve this, in general, is explained in the <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html">Chapter on
          Representation of Primary Sources</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>
          
          <p>The simplest but also the most limiting way to achieve this is to have per-page
          facsimile files and use the page break i.e. <gi>pb</gi> element to mark page
          boundaries in the transcript and then directly specify the image file of the page
          with the <att>facs</att> attribute, as illustrated in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-pb">
            <body>
              <pb facs="PNG/page1.png"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 1 encoded here -->
              <pb facs="PNG/page2.png"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 2 encoded here -->
            </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>By convention, this encoding indicates that the image indicated by the
          <att>facs</att> attribute represents the whole of the text following the
          <gi>pb</gi> element, up to the next <gi>pb</gi> element. The page break element
          can also contain a reference to the source HTML of web-harvested proceeding using
          the <att>source</att> attribute, and per-page links to audio or vidoe (cf.  the
          Section on <ref target="#sec-speechvideo">Speech and video</ref>), as illustrated
          in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-pb-source">
            <pb n="1"
                source="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2013ps/stenprot/044schuz/s044051.htm"
                xml:id="ParlaMint-CZ_2016-04-13-ps2013-044-02-006-162.pb1"
                corresp="#ps2013-044-02-006-162.audio1"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>A more complicated solution to referring to facsimiles, where it is possible
          to have several images per page (e.g. in different resolutions) or to specify
          areas of a page is enabled by the <gi>facsimile</gi> element, which should appear
          immediately before the <gi>text</gi> element of a TEI document. The example below
          refers to the first and third pages directly with the <gi>graphic</gi> element,
          whereas the second page is encoded as a <gi>surface</gi> which then contains the
          page image in two resolutions:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-facsimile">
            <facsimile>
              <graphic xml:id="page1" url="PNG/page1.png"/>
              <surface xml:id="page2">
                <graphic type="600dpi" url="PNG/page2-highRes.png"/>
                <graphic type="300dpi" url="PNG/page2-lowRes.png"/>
              </surface>
              <graphic xml:id="page3" url="PNG/page3.png"/>
            </facsimile>
          </egXML>
          
          Such definitions are then referred to via local references in <att>facs</att> attribute of
          <gi>pb</gi>, as discussed previosly.</p>
          
          <p>More complicated cases, such as delimiting portions of a page are also supported
          by the TEI Guidelines, and for these the reader is referred directly to the Section
          on <ref

        <p>A TEI encoded document is, in general, not meant to be used directly by software
        programs, rather it serves as an interchange and storage format.  Furthermore, most TEI
        documents are not "born TEI", but rather converted into TEI from some source format.
        In this section we discuss some up- and down-conversion scripts that have already been
        developed for transforming source formats into Parla-CLARIN and from Parla-CLARIN into
        formats immediately usable by software and are available in the Git repository of
        Parla-CLARIN.</p>

          <head>Conversion from Akoma Ntoso</head>
          <p>As mentioned in the Section on <ref target="#sec-akoma">Introducing Akoma
          Ntoso</ref>, this standard is used to encode parliamentary proceedings of several
          countries, and this section introduces the developed conversion of AKN documents to
          Parla-CLARIN. The example documents and conversion script can be found in the
          <code>Examples/AkomaNtoso</code> folder of the Parla-CLARIN Git repository. For a
          detailed treatment of the conversion, the XSLT script <code>akn2tei.xsl</code> should
          be consulted, while we here mention only some of the more aspects of the
          conversion.</p>

          <p>First, and on a minor point, the conversion to TEI attempts to preserve the IDs of
          the source AKN document, however, Akoma Ntoso distinguishes three ID-bearing
          attributes, namely <att>eId</att> (expression identifier), <att>wId</att> (work
          identifier) and <att>GUID</att> (globally unique identifier). The first is simply
          mapped to the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the TEI document, while the latter two
          are given in the <gi>publicationStmt</gi> of the TEI header and in the 
          <gi>idno</gi> element, as the following example illustrates:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-id">

            Some of these elements are mapped to specific TEI elements or attributes, e.g. the
            language of the text specified in the <gi>FRBRExpression</gi> maps to the
            <att>xml:lang</att> of the <gi>TEI</gi> element, but this does not hold for all the

            <gi>relation</gi> elements, so these must also specify the relation between the
            particular piece of data and the fact that it belongs to the FRBR <q>work</q>,
            <q>expression</q>, or <q>manifestation</q>. These and other formalised relations
            are taken from the formal vocabularies of <ref

            There are few points to notice in this conversion:

              <item>Where AKN qualifies its FRBR statements with the additional <att>name</att>
              attribute, which does not have a controlled vocabulary, its value is retained in
              the <att>name</att> attribute of the TEI <gi>relation</gi>.</item>

              <item>The conversion also specifies the formal equivalence (OWL
              <code>sameAs</code>) of the official FRBR definition of <q>work</q>,
              <q>expression</q>, and <q>manifestation</q> (so, <ref
              target="http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/">http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/</ref>) with the
              AKN recommended ontology of these terms, namely <ref
              target="https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot">https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/</ref>.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-convakn-qa">
          <head>Converting addressee, role, questions and answers</head>
          <p>Akoma Ntoso can directly specify not only the speaker of an utterance (as the
          value of the <att>by</att> attribute) but also the role of the speaker for a
          particular utterance (<att>as</att> attribute) and to whom the speech is addressed
          to (<att>to</att> attribute), as exemplified below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-to">
            <speech by="#khalwale" to="#speaker" as="#pm">
              <p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion:-</p>
              ...
            </speech>
          </egXML>

	  TEI has the attribute <att>toWhom</att>, which directly corresponds to the <att>to</att>
	  attribute. TEI, however, does not have an attribute that would correspond to the AKN
	  <att>as</att>, so this is encoded as the value of the general <att>ana</att> attribute,
	  which should point to the appropriate <gi>category</gi> of the pertinent taxonomy for
	  defining the roles of the speakers. The Parla-CLARIN encoding is thus:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-totei">
            <u who="#khalwale" ana="#pm" toWhom="#speaker">
              <seg>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion:-</seg>
              ...
            </u>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>A similar problem, and its solution, concerns the distinction made in Akoma
          Ntoso between questions and answers, each of which has in AKN a dedicated element,
          as shown in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-qa">
            <question eId="question_1" by="#kappa" to="#ministerEducation">
              <p>I would like to ask the Minister for Education about ...</p>
            </question>
            <answer eId="answer_1" by="#eta" as="#ministerEducation">
              <p>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for...</p>
            </answer>
          </egXML>

          In the conversion to TEI we note that someting is a question or answer (or, in fact, any
          other type of utterance) by assuming a taxonomy specifying the categories corresponding
          to the types of speeches that we wish to distinguish, and the <val>question</val> and
          <val>answer</val> are IDs of the appropriate categories. We can then refer to these
          categories in the <att>ana</att> attribute of the utterance. Furthermore, and in case we
          wish to direclty link the question and answer, we can use for this the <gi>relation</gi>
          element using its <att>name</att> with the value <code>questionAnswer</code>. Such
          <gi>listRelation</gi> can be placed in an arbitrary portion of the document, as it
          contains links to IDs, but is, by convention, best placed inside the answer. We exemplify
          the Parla-CLARIN encoding of a question and answer below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-qa-tei">
            <u xml:id="question_1" who="#kappa" toWhom="#ministerEducation" ana="#question">
              <seg>I would like to ask the Minister for Education about ...</seg>
            </u>
            <u xml:id="answer_1" who="#eta" ana="#ministerEducation #answer" toWhom="#kappa">
              <seg>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for ...</seg>
	      <listRelation>
                <relation name="questionAnswer" active="#question_1" passive="#answer_1"/>
	      </listRelation>

        <head>Conversion to RDF</head>
        <p>As explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-rdf">Introducing
        RDF</ref>, this data model would be a useful <q>down-conversion</q> of
        Parla-CLARIN corpora.</p>
        
        <p>On the tei-l mailing list there have already been discussions on how to
        link TEI with RDF, summarised and with further links in <ref
        target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1860">Issue #1860</ref> of the
        <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/">TEI GitHub project</ref>.
        The best way seems to be to either directly turn TEI markup into RDF triples,
        or, where this is not possible, to use the RDFa attribute on TEI elements.</p>

        <p>An implementation might be best approached from the opposite direction,
        i.e. developing an <q>up-conversion</q> to TEI of an existing RDF-encoded
        CPP.</p>
