BE	N-VA	CRR	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance	In the 90s, Bert Anciaoux becomes the president of People’s Union Party (VU). From this point on the leadership of the party is much more progressive. During his time of presidency, he merged the ideas of iD21 movement as well as certain regional approaches inside the party. This was something that certain Party officials could not agree with and the more radical members formed a new party called VLAAMS BLOK. The tensions inside the VU party were rising until 2001 when the Party broke down into 3 separate parts: progressive part around Bert Anciaoux which created a Party called SPIRIT; conservative part which created a Party called N-VA; and central-liberal part which created OPEN VLD.
