ParlaMint-GB_2021-02-11-lords.u1	My Lords, the Hybrid Sitting of the House will now begin. Some Members are here in the Chamber and others are participating remotely, but all Members will be treated equally After Royal Assent, Oral Questions will commence. Please can those asking supplementary questions keep them brief and confined to two points. I obviously ask Ministers to be brief as well.
ParlaMint-GB_2021-02-11-lords.u2	To ask Her Majesty’s Government what progress they have made towards enabling access to Child Trust Funds by those with a learning disability.
ParlaMint-GB_2021-02-11-lords.u25	My Lords, I regret that my noble friend is already talking about my legacy when I have only been in this House about six weeks—in future, I will make longer answers. My noble friend raises an important point. I emphasise that the constitutional position is that court procedures and rules are a matter for the courts. So far as I am concerned, we need to make sure that the response of the justice system, over the whole gamut of civil justice, is proportionate to the sum in issue and the issues which are being argued about. To that extent, I agree with the point made by my noble friend.
ParlaMint-GB_2021-02-11-lords.u26	My Lords, all supplementary questions have been asked—congratulations. We now come to the second Oral Question.
